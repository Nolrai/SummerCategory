/- Okay, let's get started!

Fong and Spivak start out by explaining preorders, which is short for "preordered sets". Whenever you have a set of things and a reasonable way deciding when anything in that set is "bigger" than some other thing, or "more expensive", or "taller", or "heavier", or "better" in any well-defined sense, or... anything like that, you've got a poset. When y is bigger than x we write x≤y. (You can also write y≥x, of course.)

What do I mean by "reasonable"? We demand that the ≤ relation obey these rules:

What do I mean by "reasonable"? We demand that the ≤ relation obey these rules:
    reflexivity: x≤x
    transitivity x≤y and y≤z imply x≤z.

A set with a relation obeying these rules is called a preorder.
